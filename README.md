Validation: Ensures that the total marks equal 120 and that inputs are within the valid range.

Categorization: Classifies students into "Progress," "Progress (module trailer)," "Module retriever," and "Exclude" based on their marks.

Data Storage: Saves progression data to a text file for future reference.

Histogram Visualization: Displays a histogram of the student progression categories.
